| ${PKGSTEM} on OpenBSD
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------

To start Tor Browser:

  $ tor-browser

This will create a ~/TorBrowser-Data directory tree if it does not
exist.

Tor Browser uses its own instance of the tor server running on a
different port than the net/tor port is configured to use by default.
It starts and stops this tor daemon using the integrated tor-launcher.
It should not interfere with any tor daemon you have running via the
standard mechanism (e.g. rcctl start tor).

The tor instance used by Tor Browser stores its configuration in
~/TorBrowser-Data/Tor/torrc; the tor daemon stores state files in
~/TorBrowser-Data/Tor.

As of the 12.5 release, torrc has been moved from
~/TorBrowser-Data/torrc to ~/TorBrowser-Data/Tor/torrc.
If you wish to preserve your tor configuration (e.g., bridges),
please do the following BEFORE starting tor-browser after you upgrade:

  $ mv ~/TorBrowser-Data/torrc ~/TorBrowser-Data/Tor

When you use Tor Browser to change your configuration (e.g. add
bridges) the above torrc is updated.  You can also add bridges by
editing your torrc yourself.  Make sure Tor Browser is not running
before doing so if you use this method; if Tor Browser is running it
might overwrite your torrc.

NOTE: on OpenBSD, the only Pluggable Transports that are available
for now are meek-azure, obfs4 and snowflake.  Pluggable Transports have
a web page worth reading:
