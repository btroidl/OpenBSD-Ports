Tor Browser (TB) is a modified version of Mozilla's Firefox Extended
Service Release customized for web browsing over the Tor anonymity
network. In addition to obscuring the client's IP address, TB also
mitigates browser fingerprinting attacks and patches the Mozilla code
in other ways to prevent privacy leaks.

Tor Browser includes the patched version of Firefox ESR and the NoScript
Firefox add-on, a well-known add-on that allows flexible blocking
of JS.  The version in the Tor Browser ports is specifically configured
for use in Tor Browser by the Tor project and is not for use with other
Mozilla-based browsers.
