This is a Python meta-package which can be used in pyproject.toml files
to automatically provide as a build-time dependency on Numpy.

Normally it is used to depend on the oldest version that supports the
given Python version and platform where a pre-built Numpy wheel is
available, such that compiled extensions are ABI-compatible with a
wider range of Numpy versions.

For OpenBSD packages where we manage dependencies internally and
don't use upstream pre-built wheels, this is modified to allow any
version.
