RFC 6647 graylisting policy server, following the recommended practice
noted in the standard document.
Graylisting defers message acceptance (for a specific recipient / sender
/ client_address value tuple) a configurable number of times
via a standardized SMTP response (see allow(5), RFC 5321), which does
not prevent message delivery from SMTP M(ail) T(ransfer) A(gent)s,
but can help against simple spam producing programs.

s-postgray clients are started via spawn(8), as shown in the manual.
The server is started by clients as necessary, but it can be --startup
also since v0.8.0.

s-postgray needs to be configured as the builtin DB store path is /tmp
(see manual), user and group settings are inherited from spawn(8) (or
the environment which uses --startup).
