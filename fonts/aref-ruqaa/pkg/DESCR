Aref Ruqaa is an Arabic typeface that aspires to capture the essence
of the classical Ruqaa calligraphic style.

The Arabic part of Aref Ruqaa is designed by the Arabic calligrapher
and type designer Abdullah Aref, while the Latin part is based on
AMS Euler, but spaced for regular text rather than mathematics.
