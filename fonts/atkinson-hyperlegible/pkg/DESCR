Atkinson Hyperlegible is a typeface created in partnership with Braille
Institute. It has been developed specifically to increase legibility for
readers with low vision, and to improve comprehension.

Named for the founder of Braille Institute, Atkinson Hyperlegible is a
traditional grotesque sans-serif at its core. It departs from tradition
to incorporate umambiguous, distinctive and at times, unexpected always
with the goal of increasing character recognition, and ultimately
improve reading.
