The Neue Black is a display sans serif with a robust character set that has
over 25 ligatures and various inktrap alternates.

Created in 2020, The Neue Black is based on the signage from the Chicago
Freedom Movement, an advocacy campaign spearheaded by Martin Luther King,
Jr. and the Southern Christian Leadership Conference (SCLC). The campaign
marked the expansion of their civil rights activities from the South to the
northern cities.
