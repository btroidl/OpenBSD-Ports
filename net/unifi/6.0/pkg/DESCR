This package contains controller software for Ubiquiti UniFi access points,
switches, gateways and phones.

This branch 6.0 contains the newest version of the controller that still
officially supports the original Atheros-based UniFi 11n AP and some
others:

UAP-Outdoor		UAP-Outdoor+
UAP-Pro			UAP-IW
UAP (v1+v2)		UAP-LR (v1+v2)
UAP-AC-EDU		UAP-AC-IW-PRO

However, at the time of writing the current 7.4 releases do still support
these devices, so you may prefer to try those first as 6.0 is quite outdated.
