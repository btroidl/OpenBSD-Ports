If you have UAP-AC (squareish Broadcom device), UAP-AC-Outdoor
or UAP-Outdoor-5, use the 5.6 branch.

For UAP-Outdoor, UAP-Outdoor+, UAP-Pro, UAP-IW, UAP (v1+v2), UAP-LR
(v1+v2), UAP-AC-EDU, UAP-AC-IW-PRO, official support was dropped after
the 6.0 branch, however (at least as of mid 2023) they do still work
with 7.4 releases.
