The SolarEdge Interface provides both a command-line interface, and a
Python module interface to interact with the SolarEdge API service.

- All (documented) SolarEdge API endpoints are implemented with
  multisite support for endpoints that provide multisite queries.
- Response data for all endpoints are available as a Python-dict
  structure, a Pandas-DataFrame or as raw-JSON.
- The command-line interface output can be formatted as a CSV; as a
  Pandas style JSON structure or; as plain-JSON.
- Timestamps can be returned as datetime values with their respective
  site timezones applied. Doing so is the default behaviour, however
  this can be disabled if required.
- Configuration via environment variables or config file is possible,
  thus making it safer to manage your API key value(s).
