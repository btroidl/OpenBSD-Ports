Pymodbus is a full Modbus protocol implementation using a synchronous or
asynchronous (using asyncio) core.

Supported modbus communication modes: tcp, rtu-over-tcp, udp, serial, tls

Pymodbus can be used without any third party dependencies (aside from pyserial)
and is a very lightweight project.

Pymodbus also provides a lot of ready to use examples as well as a
server/client simulator which can be controlled via a REST API and can be
easily integrated into test suites.
