EPIC5 is the 5th generation of the Enhanced Programmable ircII Client.

No longer is EPIC 100% backwards compatible with ircII, but instead
those things where compatibility is undesirable have been found and
fixed. No gratuitous incompatibilities have been added, but lots of
new code has been added to make EPIC one of the best ircII clients
available.

Due to its minimalist approach it is highly recommended you use a script
with EPIC, basic knowledge about ircII scripting can be obtained here:
http://help.epicsol.org/epic_scripting. Some scripts also included in
distribution.

EPIC5 supports pledge() and unveil().

Support is available on #epic@efnet.
