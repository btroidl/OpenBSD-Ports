============================

To change default server list set IRCLIB environment variable in your shell
pointing to a directory (e.g. ~/.epic/) and put ircII.servers file there, each
line of the file describing a server, format is documented in
http://help.epicsol.org/server_description

Example for Libera.Chat:

irc.libera.chat:7000:password=MYPASSWORD:nick=MYNICK:type=IRC-SSL

Don't forget to 'chmod 0600' the file, if you use passwords there.

SASL is supported by sasl_auth (PLAIN method only, use SSL) and sasl_nistp256
scripts. Look comments in those scripts to get more details how to use them.
