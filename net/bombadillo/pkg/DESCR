Bombadillo is a non-web browser for the terminal that features a full
terminal user interface, vim-like keybindings, document pager,
configurable settings, and a robust command selection.

Currently, Bombadillo supports the following protocols as first class
citizens:

 - gopher
 - gemini
 - finger
 - local (a user's file system)

Web support is opt-in (turned off by default).  Links can be opened in a
user's default web browser when in a graphical environment or rendered
directly in Bombadillo if Lynx, w3m, or elinks are available.
