IP4R is a PostgreSQL extension which supports 6 data types allowing
you to store IPv4 & IPv6 addresses in a PostgreSQL table:

  ip4   - a single IPv4 address
  ip4r  - an arbitrary range of IPv4 addresses
  ip6   - a single IPv6 address
  ip6r  - an arbitrary range of IPv6 addresses
  ipaddress  - a single IPv4 or IPv6 address
  iprange    - an arbitrary range of IPv4 or IPv6 addresses

While PostgreSQL already has builtin types 'inet' and 'cidr', the
authors of this module found that they had a number of requirements
that were not addressed by the builtin types.
