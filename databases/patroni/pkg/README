Patroni can be considered as a wrapper around PostgreSQL server which makes
HA cluster management tasks easier.
When running Patroni, make sure that postgresql is not enabled in
rc.conf.local(8) and PostgreSQL administration tasks such as server startup
and shutdown are performed with patronictl utility.

Patroni can use different distributed configuration stores (DCS), and requires
installation of the appropriate python module for DCS, e.g. to use HashiCorp
Consul, install py3-consul module.
Provided example configuration assumes that HashiCorp Consul is used for DCS.

To initialize PostgreSQL Patroni cluster, review and edit example configuration
file located in /etc/patroni/patroni.yml.

Commented-out options show the PostgreSQL defaults which should be reviewed
before cluster initialization.

Topics related to system tuning, PostgreSQL upgrades are covered in PostgreSQL
server port readme.
