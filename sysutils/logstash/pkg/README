OpenBSD-specific Limitations
============================
OpenBSD is not on the list of supported platforms:
https://www.elastic.co/support/matrix

Running Logstash
================
Logstash should be started with it's own uid/gid _logstash, since this user
has all necessary filesystem permissions. For example, to install opensearch
output plugin:

    $ doas su -s /bin/sh -c daemon _logstash -c \
        '/usr/local/logstash/bin/logstash-plugin install --version 2.0.1 \
        logstash-output-opensearch'

Upgrading Logstash
==================
Please refer to the upstream documentation when performing upgrades:
https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/logstash/current/upgrading-logstash.html
