Restic is a modern backup program that can back up your files:
  - from Linux, BSD, Mac and Windows
  - to many different storage types, including self-hosted and online
    services
  - easily, being a single executable that you can run without a server
    or complex setup
  - effectively, only transferring the parts that actually changed in
    the files you back up
  - securely, by careful use of cryptography in every part of the process
  - verifiably, enabling you to make sure that your files can be restored
    when needed
  - freely - restic is entirely free to use and completely open source

Supported backends include:
  - Local directory
  - sftp server (via SSH)
  - HTTP REST server (protocol rest-server)
  - AWS S3 (either from Amazon or using the Minio server)
  - OpenStack Swift
  - BackBlaze B2
  - Microsoft Azure Blob Storage
  - Google Cloud Storage
