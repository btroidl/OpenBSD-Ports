Mitogen is a Python library for writing distributed self-replicating
programs. Its main feature is enabling your Python program to bootstrap
and communicate with new copies of itself under its control running on
remote machines, using only an existing installed Python interpreter and
SSH client,

There is no requirement for installing packages, copying files around,
writing shell snippets, upfront configuration, or providing any
secondary link to a remote machine aside from an SSH connection. Due
to its origins for use in managing potentially damaged infrastructure,
the remote machine need not even have free disk space or a writeable
filesystem.

This includes Mitogen for Ansible, a redesigned UNIX connection layer
and module runtime for Ansible. Requiring minimal configuration changes,
it updates Ansible's and wasteful shell-centric implementation with
pure-Python equivalents, invoked via highly efficient remote procedure
calls to persistent interpreters tunnelled over SSH. No changes are
required to target hosts. (See the documentation for more information;
use ${PREFIX}/share/ansible_mitogen/plugins/strategy as your path for
strategy_plugins).
