A graphical interface for the OpenBSD package manager.

It has features such as:
- fast local search
- including packages DESCR content in searches
- packages sorted in categories: GUI, Terminal UI, Other

The categories are determined by looking at each packages dependencies
and trying to guess in which category it belongs.

GUI: packages using toolkits such as Gtk, Qt, SDL...
Terminal UI: packages using curses
Other: packages that didn't match any criteria
