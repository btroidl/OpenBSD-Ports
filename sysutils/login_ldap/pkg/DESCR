login_ldap provides an authentication mechanism through bsdauth to
authenticate users against an LDAP server.

New installations should not use this package, but instead use
login_ldap(8) in the base OS. This package is provided for backwards
compatibility because the configuration method is different (the version
in the base OS uses login_ldap.conf instead of various parameters in
/etc/login.conf).
