A small Python module for determining appropriate platform-specific dirs,
e.g. system and user directories for data, config, cache, logs, etc.

When writing desktop application, finding the right location for these
varies per platform. Even for single-platform apps, there may by plenty
of nuances in figuring out the right location (e.g. they vary between
different versions of Windows, etc).

platformdirs will help you choose an appropriate directory.
