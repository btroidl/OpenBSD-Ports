This library implements an efficient, compact-output, and feature-rich
serializer using a binary protocol called Sereal.

Its sister module p5-Sereal-Decoder implements a decoder for this format.

Always upgrade the Decoder before the Encoder. The latest version of
the decoder should be able to handle the output from any earlier or
equivalent version of the encoder. Ignoring this advice may result
in data loss in an environment where you cannot upgrade the encoder
simultaneously on all machines using the package.
