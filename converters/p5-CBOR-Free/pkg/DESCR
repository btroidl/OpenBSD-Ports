The Concise Binary Object Representation (CBOR, RFC 8949) is a data
format whose design goals include the possibility of extremely small
code size, fairly small message size, and extensibility without the need
for version negotiation.
This library implements CBOR via XS under a license that permits
commercial usage with no "strings attached".
