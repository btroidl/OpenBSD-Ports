This module converts Perl data structures to the Concise Binary
Object Representation (CBOR) and vice versa.  CBOR is a fast binary
serialisation format that aims to use an (almost) superset of the
JSON data model, i.e. when you can represent something useful in
JSON, you should be able to represent it in CBOR.
