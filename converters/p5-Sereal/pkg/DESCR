Sereal is an efficient, compact-output, binary and feature-rich
serialization protocol. The Perl encoder is implemented as the
Sereal::Encoder module, the Perl decoder correspondingly as
Sereal::Decoder. They are distributed separately to allow for safe
upgrading without downtime. (Hint: Upgrade the decoder everywhere
first, then the encoder.)

This "Sereal" module is a very thin wrapper around both
"Sereal::Encoder" and "Sereal::Decoder". It depends on both and loads
both. So if you have a user of both encoder and decoder, it is enough
to depend on a particular version of "Sereal" and you'll get the most
recent released versions of "Sereal::Encoder" and "Sereal::Decoder"
whose version is smaller than or equal to the version of "Sereal" you
depend on.
