PSUtils is a suite of utilities for manipulating PDF and PostScript documents.
You can select and rearrange pages, including arrangement into signatures for
booklet printing, combine multple pages into a single page for n-up printing,
and resize, flip and rotate pages.

PostScript files should conform to the PostScript Document Structuring
Conventions (DSC); however, PSUtils intentionally does not check this, as some
programs produce non-conforming output that can be successfully processed
anyway.
If PSUtils does not work for you, check whether your software needs to be
configured to produce DSC-conformant PostScript.
