KBibTeX is a reference management application which can be used to collect
TeX/LaTeX bibliographies and export them in various formats.

KBibTeX can do the following things:

 - Preview bibliography entries in various formats (Source (BibTeX), Source
   (RIS), Wikipedia, standard (XML/XSLT), fancy (XML/XSLT), and abstract-only
   (XML/XSLT)). Additional preview styles become available when bibtex2html is
   installed.
 - Import data in various bibliography file formats such as BibTeX,
   RIS and ISI and export data to PDF (requires pdflatex), PostScrip,
   RTF, and HTML.
 - Search for the bibliography entries data in online databases (e.g. Google
   Scholar, ACM, IEEE, arXiv, etc.)
 - Preview local or remote (online) resources, e.g. PDF files, linked in the
   BibTEX entry.
 - Find and merge duplicate entries in bibliography.
 - Integrate your bibliographies with LaTeX editors such as Kile and LyX.
 - Import your Zotero library.
