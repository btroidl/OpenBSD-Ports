KDE System Guard, also known as KSysGuard, is the task manager and performance
monitor for the KDE platform on Unix-like systems. It can monitor both local
and remote hosts, accomplished via running ksysguardd on the remote host, and
having the GUI (ksysguard) connect to the remote instance. It can retrieve
simple values or complex data such as tables and display this information in a
variety of graphical displays. Displays can then be organized in work sheets.
It also provides a detailed top-like process table.
