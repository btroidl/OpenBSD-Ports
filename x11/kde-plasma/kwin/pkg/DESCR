KWin is the window manager for the KDE Plasma Desktop.  It gives you complete
control over your windows, making sure they're not in the way but aid you in
your task. It paints the window decoration, the bar on top of every window with
buttons like close, maximize and minimize. It also handles placing of windows
and switching between them.

KWin supports compositing, which means using 3D effects for handling your
windows. This can make window management smoother, easier, more efficient and
more natural. It's hardware requirements are very modest and pretty much every
reasonably modern system since 2002 supports it.
