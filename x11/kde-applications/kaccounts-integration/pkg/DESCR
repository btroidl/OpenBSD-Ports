Integration library and QML module for Accounts-SSO and SignOn-SSO.

KAccounts Integration provides a way to share accounts data such as login
tokens and general user information (like usernames and such) between various
applications.

The KAccounts library is a KDE Frameworks style abstraction layer on top of the
Accounts-SSO and SignOnD libraries, which uses a combination of models and jobs
to expose the functionality of those.
