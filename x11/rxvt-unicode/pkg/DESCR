rxvt-unicode is a customizable terminal emulator forked from rxvt.
Features of rxvt-unicode include international language support through
Unicode, transparency, the ability to display multiple font types and
support for Perl extensions.

The standard package mostly follows upstream's default build options,
with only 256-colour support added.

Other flavours are available:

	everything - built with "--enable-everything" to enable all
	  features, including some heavier-weight ones

	small - built with only limited options (to reduce size
	  and dependencies)
