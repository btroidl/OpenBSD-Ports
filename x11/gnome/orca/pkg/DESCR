Orca is a free, open source, flexible, and extensible screen reader that
provides access to the graphical desktop via user-customizable combinations of
speech and/or braille.

Orca works with applications and toolkits that support the assistive technology
service provider interface (AT-SPI).
Applications and toolkits supporting the AT-SPI include the GNOME GTK+ toolkit,
the Java platform's Swing toolkit, OpenOffice/LibreOffice, Gecko, and WebKitGtk.

Optional dependencies:
* brltty: support for braille
* gstreamer1-plugins-good: support for sound
* liblouis: support for contracted braille
* libwnck3: support for mouse
