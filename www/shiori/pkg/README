| Running ${PKGSTEM} on OpenBSD
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------

Shiori can be run system wide or per user.

If you run it per user it will place its data directory on
${XDG_DATA_HOME}/shiori and will use sqlite3 by default.  Check
https://github.com/go-shiori/shiori/blob/master/docs/Configuration.md
for more information

On OpenBSD, it is also ready to run system wide.
By default, it will also use the sqlite3 backend and place its data on
${LOCALSTATEDIR}/shiori
One can modify the environment variables needed for configuration by
modifying the login class located at ${SYSCONFDIR}/login.conf.d/shiori


Web Interface
=============

${PKGSTEM} serves up a web interface on:

	 http://localhost:8080

If you wish to listen on a different interface, port, etc, you can
modify it via rcctl:

	# rcctl set shiori flags -a 0.0.0.0 -p 1234

The default user password for the web interface is "shiori/gopher".
The first new account you add will become the owner and it will
deactivate the "shiori/gopher" default user automatically.
