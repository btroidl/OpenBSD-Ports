Requests is a widely used high-level HTTP library for Python, based on
the lower-level urllib3.

It allows you to send HTTP/1.1 requests extremely easily. There's no
need to manually add query strings to your URLs, or to form-encode
your POST data; you can add headers, form data, multipart files, and
parameters with simple Python dictionaries, and access the response data
in the same way.

Features include:

- Keep-Alive & Connection Pooling
- International Domains and URLs
- Sessions with Cookie Persistence
- Browser-style SSL Verification
- Automatic Content Decoding
- HTTP(S) Proxy Support
- Multipart File Uploads
- Streaming Downloads
- Connection Timeouts
- Chunked Requests
