sway is an i3-compatible Wayland compositor.

Configuration

If you already use i3, then copy your i3 config to
`~/.config/sway/config` and it'll work out of the box. Otherwise, copy
the sample configuration file to `~/.config/sway/config`. It is
usually located at `/etc/sway/config`.  Run `man 5 sway` for
information on the configuration.

Running

On OpenBSD, create a script (call it startwl for example) containing :

#! /bin/ksh
export XDG_RUNTIME_DIR=/tmp/run/$(id -u)
if [ ! -d $XDG_RUNTIME_DIR ]; then
    mkdir -m 700 -p $XDG_RUNTIME_DIR
fi
export WLR_DRM_DEVICES=/dev/dri/card0
export LIBSEAT_BACKEND=noop

# export MOZ_ENABLE_WAYLAND=1 # doesn't work yet
export XDG_CURRENT_DESKTOP=sway

exec sway $*
