Swayimg is a lightweight image viewer for Wayland display servers.

In a Sway compatible mode, the viewer creates an "overlay" above the
currently active window, which gives the illusion that you are opening
the image directly in a terminal window.

Supported image formats: JPEG, JPEG XL, PNG, GIF, SVG, WebP,
HEIF/AVIF, TIFF, EXR, BMP, PNM
