DER ASCII is a small human-editable language to emit DER (Distinguished
Encoding Rules) or BER (Basic Encoding Rules) encodings of ASN.1 structures
and malformed variants of them.

The package provides two tools, ascii2der and der2ascii, to convert DER
ASCII to a byte string and vice versa. These tools may be used to create
test inputs by taking an existing DER or BER structure, disassembling it
with der2ascii into DER ASCII, making adjustments, and assembling back into
binary with ascii2der. This avoids having to manually fix up all the length
prefixes. As a bonus, it acts as a human-readable view for DER structures.
