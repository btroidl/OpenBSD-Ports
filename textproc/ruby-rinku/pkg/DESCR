Rinku is a Ruby library that does autolinking. It parses text and turns
anything that remotely resembles a link into an HTML link, just like the
Ruby on Rails auto_link method -- but it's about 20 times faster,
because it's written in C, and it's about 20 times smarter when linking,
because it does actual parsing instead of RegEx replacements.
