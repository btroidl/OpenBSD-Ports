Anaphora Resolution is the process of resolving references (anaphora) to
earlier items (antecedents) in discourse. The most common form of this is
Pronominal Anaphora, where the anaphor is a pronoun and the antecedent is
a noun.

The apertium-anaphora module adds this capability to the Apertium machine
translation toolkit.
