The diff match and patch libraries offer robust algorithms to perform
the operations required for synchronizing plain text.

This library implements Myer's diff algorithm which is generally
considered to be the best general-purpose diff. A layer of pre-diff
speedups and post-diff cleanups surround the diff algorithm, improving
both performance and output quality.

This library also implements a Bitap matching algorithm at the heart
of a flexible matching and patching strategy.
