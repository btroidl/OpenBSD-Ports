SIRIL is an astronomical image processing tool.

It is specially tailored for noise reduction and improving the
signal/noise ratio of an image from multiple captures, as required
in astronomy.  SIRIL can align automatically or manually, stack and
enhance pictures from various file formats, even image sequence
files (films and SER files).  It works well with limited system
resources, like in embedded platforms, but is also very fast when
run on more powerful computers.
