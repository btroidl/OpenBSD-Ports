XZ Utils provide a general purpose data compression library and
command line tools. The native file format is the .xz format, but
also the legacy .lzma format is supported. The .xz format supports
multiple compression algorithms, of which LZMA2 is currently the
primary algorithm. With typical files, XZ Utils create about 30 %
smaller files than gzip.
