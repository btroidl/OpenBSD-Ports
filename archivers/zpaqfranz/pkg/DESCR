zpaq is a free and open source incremental, journaling command-line
archiver, designed and first implemented by Matt Mahoney. zpaq is
faster and compresses better than most other popular archivers and
backup programs, especially for realistic backups that have a lot of
duplicate files and a lot of already compressed files.

zpaqfranz is a fork of the original zpaq archiver and continues to be
maintained.
