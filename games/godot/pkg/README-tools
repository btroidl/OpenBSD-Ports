Using MSBuild/C#/Mono
=====================

MSBuild is used by Godot to compile the assemblies for C# projects. In order
for it to run without error, you need to remove the following line from
~/.nuget/packages/godot.net.sdk/3.3.0/Sdk/Sdk.targets:

	TargetFrameworkFallbackSearchPaths="$(TargetFrameworkFallbackSearchPaths)"

If the file doesn't exist, it hasn't been installed yet. You may need to run a
build with MSBuild in Godot first before the file is created.

Modules
=======

Note that this version includes the module "GodotSteam" in its namespace which
is not part of the default Godot install. This is mainly for compatibility with
runtime of prepackaged games. It communicates with games/goldberg_emulator, not
an official Steam client. Making use of the Steam.* namespace for development
may lead to unexpected behavior, so use at your own risk.
