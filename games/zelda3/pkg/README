Official documentation
======================

See the project wiki at https://github.com/snesrev/zelda3/wiki/

Usage
=====

This game requires proprietary assets to run, which can be installed
using the games/zelda3-data port.

Because this game reads and creates files in the current working
directory it is recommended to start the game inside a dedicated
directory: mkdir ~/zelda3; cd ~/zelda3; zelda3

The game creates a 'saves' directory in the current working directory
where save states are stored.

The game reads the configuration file zelda3.ini, which must be placed
in the current working directory where the game is started. An example
can be found at ${LOCALBASE}/share/examples/zelda3/zelda3.ini.
All optional features which enhance or change the original gameplay
experience must be manually enabled in zelda3.ini.

Sound
=====

Sound is disabled by default and can be enabled in zelda3.ini.
The example zelda3.ini file provided by the package enables sound.

Controls
========

Keyboard Control Button Mapping
-------------------------------

The default mapping of joypad buttons to keyboard keys is as follows:

| Button | Key         |
| ------ | ----------- |
| Up     | Up arrow    |
| Down   | Down arrow  |
| Left   | Left arrow  |
| Right  | Right arrow |
| Start  | Enter       |
| Select | Right shift | (example zelda3.ini overrides this, see below)
| A      | X           |
| B      | Z           |
| X      | S           |
| Y      | A           |
| L      | C           |
| R      | V           |
+--------+-------------+

Keys can be reconfigured in zelda3.ini.

Because the 'Right shift' key did not work during initial play-testing
on OpenBSD, the example zelda3.ini provided in the package uses the
following keys for the Select button instead:

| Keyboard | Key |
| -------- | --- |
| QWERTY   |  /  |
| QWERTZ   |  -  |
| AZERTY   |  !  |
+----------+-----+

Additionally, the following commands are available:

| Key          | Action
| ------------ | -------------------------------------------
| Tab          | Turbo mode
| W            | Fill health/magic
| Shift+W      | Fill rupees/bombs/arrows

opion in zelda3.ini.
