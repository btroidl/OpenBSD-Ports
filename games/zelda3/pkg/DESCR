This is a reverse-engineered clone of Zelda 3 - A Link to the Past.

It's around 70-80kLOC of C code, and reimplements all parts of the
original game. The game is playable from start to end.

A bunch of features have been added that are not supported by the
original game. Some of them are:
- Support for pixel shaders.
- Support for enhanced aspect ratios of 16:9 or 16:10.
- Higher quality world map.
- Support for MSU audio tracks.
- Secondary item slot on button X (Hold X in inventory to select).
- Switching current item with L/R keys.
- Alternative sprites for the game's protagonist.

This game requires proprietary assets to run, which can be installed
using the games/zelda3-data port.
