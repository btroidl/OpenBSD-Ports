Game Data
=========

To play the game you will need an original Doom, Ultimate Doom, Doom II,
Final Doom, Heretic, Hexen, or Strife IWAD.  The games data files will
be named as follows:

  o DOOM1.WAD .................. Doom Shareware
  o DOOM.WAD ................... Doom Registered or Ultimate Doom
  o DOOM2.WAD .................. Doom II: Hell on Earth
  o PLUTONIA.WAD ............... Final Doom: The Plutonia Experiment
  o TNT.WAD .................... Final Doom: TNT Evilution
  o HERETIC1.WAD ............... Heretic Shareware
  o HERETIC.WAD ................ Heretic: Shadow of the Serpent Riders
  o HEXEN.WAD .................. Hexen demo and commercial versions
  o STRIFE0.WAD ................ Strife Shareware
  o STRIFE1.WAD + VOICES.WAD ... Strife: Quest for the Sigil

Place one or more of the above-listed files in ${PREFIX}/share/doom/
to play.

NOTE: Crispy Doom is case-insensitive when loading files, just as the
original for DOS was.  This means you do not have to reference the files
in CAPS to load via `-iwad' or `-file' parameters.

Launching a Game
================

Depending on which game you want to play, launch with the executable
matching the game data installed.  There are four options:

  o crispy-doom
  o crispy-heretic
  o crispy-hexen
  o crispy-strife

Run `crispy-<game>-setup' to generate a configuration file to your
liking.

If multiple IWADs are installed, you may specify the one you want to
play via the `-iwad' command-line parameter:

  $ crispy-doom -iwad doom.wad
  $ crispy-heretic -iwad heretic1.wad

FreeDoom IWADs from the freedoom and freedm packages are supported as
well, specify freedoom1.wad, freedoom2.wad, or freedm.wad for those.

Multiplayer Games
=================

See the crispy-<game>(6) manpages for additional information.  If a
dedicated server is desired, see the crispy-server(6) manpage.

Shareware Data
==============

The Doom Shareware IWAD is available in the `doomdata' package.  Other
shareware is available from the Doomworld idgames archive website:

  Heretic: https://www.doomworld.com/idgames/idstuff/heretic/htic_v12
  Hexen: https://www.doomworld.com/idgames/idstuff/hexen/hexndemo
  Strife: https://www.doomworld.com/idgames/roguestuff/strife11
