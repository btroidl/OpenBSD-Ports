FreeXL is an open source library to extract valid data from within
Spreadsheets. The following document formats are supported starting
since version 2.0:
- MS Excel legacy BIFF binary format (.xls)
- MS Excel new XML-based format (.xlsx)
- Free/OpenOffice Calc XML-based format (.ods)

FreeXL intends to be simple, lightweight, and completely ignores any
GUI-related oddity.  Note that the final goal means that FreeXL ignores
at all fonts, sizes and alignments, and most formats. It ignores Pivot
Table, Charts, Formulas, Visual Basic macros and so on.
