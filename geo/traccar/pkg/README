Web Interface
=============

The default configuration makes traccar UI listen on localhost only.
The recommended way to access the service from the outside world is to use a
reverse proxy with SSL enabled.

The following is an example using nginx as an SSL reverse proxy:

server {
	add_header Cache-Control no-cache;
	add_header x-frame-options SAMEORIGIN;
	add_header X-Content-Type-Options nosniff;
	add_header X-XSS-Protection "1; mode=block";

	listen	443;
	listen	[::]:443;

	expires 31d;
	ssl On;
	ssl_certificate fullcert_nokey.pem;
	ssl_certificate_key privkey.pem;

	location / {
		proxy_pass http://127.0.0.1:8082/;
		proxy_set_header Host $host;
		proxy_http_version 1.1;
		proxy_set_header Upgrade $http_upgrade;
		proxy_set_header Connection "upgrade";
		proxy_buffering     off;
		proxy_connect_timeout 1d;
		proxy_send_timeout    1d;
		proxy_read_timeout    1d;
		proxy_redirect off;
		proxy_set_header Proxy "";
		proxy_cookie_path /api "/api; secure; HttpOnly";
	}
}

Open Network Ports
==================

By default, traccar will listen on many network ports. Each tracker protocol
requires its own open port, which requires a large number of file descriptors
and may conflict with other software.

The list of protocols can be seen in ${SYSCONFDIR}/traccar/default.xml, along
with various other settings, but do not edit defalut.xml. Instead, you can
list the specific protocols to enable in ${SYSCONFDIR}/traccar/traccar.xml.
For examply, to allow only teltonika and osmand protocols, add this:

 <entry key='protocols.enable'>teltonika,osmand</entry>

You may like to override other settings from default.xml - again, change
traccar.xml instead by copying the entry to override. For example, to
avoid sending positions to a network-based reverse geocoder service:

  <entry key='geocoder.enable'>false</entry>
