PyGeoIf provides a GeoJSON-like protocol for geo-spatial (GIS) vector data.

You may think of pygeoif as a shapely ultralight which lets you
construct geometries and perform very basic operations like reading and
writing geometries from/to WKT, constructing line strings out of points,
polygons from linear rings, multi polygons from polygons, etc. It was
inspired by shapely and implements the geometries in a way that when you
are familiar with shapely you feel right at home with pygeoif.
