shaderc is a collection of tools, libraries and tests for shader
compilation. At the moment it includes:

 - glslc, a command line compiler for GLSL/HLSL to SPIR-V, and
 - libshaderc, a library API for accessing glslc functionality.

glslc wraps around core functionality in glslang and SPIRV-Tools. glslc
and its library aims to to provide:

 - a command line compiler with GCC- and Clang-like usage, for better
   integration with build systems
 - an API where functionality can be added without breaking existing
   clients
 - an API supporting standard concurrency patterns across multiple
   operating systems
 - increased functionality such as file #include support
