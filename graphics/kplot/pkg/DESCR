kplot is a programming library for plotting graphs on a Cairo
surface. It handles drawing margins, axis labels, tic labels, tics,
borders, grids, and the data itself. Data may be specified structurally
as finite buckets, range histograms, arrays, and vectors. Data may
also be computed from other sources, such as the mean and standard
deviation.

This version has been patched to work with siril
