Tifffile is a Python library to

- store NumPy arrays in TIFF (Tagged Image File Format) files, and
- read image and metadata from TIFF-like files used in bioimaging.

Image and metadata can be read from TIFF, BigTIFF, OME-TIFF, STK, LSM,
SGI, NIHImage, ImageJ, MicroManager, FluoView, ScanImage, SEQ, GEL, SVS,
SCN, SIS, BIF, ZIF (Zoomable Image File Format), QPTIFF (QPI), NDPI, and
GeoTIFF files.

Image data can be read as NumPy arrays or Zarr arrays/groups from
strips, tiles, pages (IFDs), SubIFDs, higher order series, and pyramidal
levels.

Image data can be written to TIFF, BigTIFF, OME-TIFF, and ImageJ
hyperstack compatible files in multi-page, volumetric, pyramidal,
memory-mappable, tiled, predicted, or compressed form.

Tifffile can also be used to inspect TIFF structures, read image data
from multi-dimensional file sequences, write fsspec ReferenceFileSystem
for TIFF files and image file sequences, patch TIFF tag values, and
parse many proprietary metadata formats.
