LuaBridge is a lightweight and dependency-free library for mapping data,
functions, and classes back and forth between C++ and Lua, a powerful,
fast, lightweight, embeddable scripting language. LuaBridge has been
tested and works with Lua revisions starting from 5.1.5, although it
should work in any version of Lua from 5.1.0 and later. It also works
transparently with LuaJIT.

LuaBridge offers the following features:

- MIT Licensed, no usage restrictions!
- Headers-only: No Makefile, no .cpp files, just one #include!
- Simple, light, and nothing else needed (like Boost).
- No macros, settings, or configuration scripts needed.
- Supports different object lifetime management models.
- Convenient, type-safe access to the Lua stack.
- Automatic function parameter type binding.
- Easy access to Lua objects like tables and functions.
- Written in a clear and easy to debug style.
- C++11 compliant.
