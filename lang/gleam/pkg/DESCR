Gleam is a fast, friendly, and functional language for building
type-safe, scalable systems.

It compiles to Erlang (or JavaScript) and has straightforward interop
with other BEAM languages such as Erlang, Elixir, and LFE.

It features algebraic data-types, immutable data structures, full type
inference, fast compilation, generics, no nulls nor exceptions, and a
few bonus features such as helpful error messages.
