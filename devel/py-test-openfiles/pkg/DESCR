The pytest-openfiles plugin allows for the detection of open I/O
resources at the end of unit tests. This is particularly useful for
testing code that manipulates file handles or other I/O resources. It
allows developers to ensure that this kind of code properly cleans up
I/O resources when they are no longer needed.
