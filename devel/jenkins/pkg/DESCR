Jenkins is a self-contained, open source automation server which can be
used to automate all sorts of tasks related to building, testing, and
delivering or deploying software.

As an extensible automation server, Jenkins can be used as a simple CI
(Continuous Integration) server or turned into the continuous delivery
hub for any project.

Jenkins can be extended via its plugin architecture. Hundreds of plugins
are available in the Update Center integrating with practically every
tool in the continuous integration and continuous delivery toolchain.
 
It can easily distribute work across multiple machines, helping drive
builds, tests and deployments across multiple platforms faster.

Jenkins can be easily set up and configured via its web interface,
which includes on-the-fly error checks and built-in help.
