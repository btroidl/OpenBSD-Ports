This library is the reference implementation of the Python wheel
packaging standard, as defined in PEP 427.

It has two different roles:

- A setuptools extension for building wheels that provides the
   'bdist_wheel' setuptools command

- A command line tool for working with wheel files

It should be noted that wheel is **not** intended to be used as a
library, and as such there is no stable, public API.
