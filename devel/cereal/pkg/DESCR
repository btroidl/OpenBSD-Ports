Cereal is a header-only C++11 serialization library. It takes
arbitrary data types and reversibly turns them into different
representations, such as compact binary encodings, XML, or JSON.

Cereal was designed to be fast, light-weight, and easy to extend -
it has no external dependencies and can be easily bundled with
other code or used standalone.
