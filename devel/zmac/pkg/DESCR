zmac is a Z-80 macro cross-assembler. It has all the features you'd
expect. It assembles the specified input file (with a '.z' extension if
there is no pre-existing extension and the file as given doesn't exist)
and produces program output in many different formats. It also produces
a nicely-formatted listing of the machine code and cycle counts
alongside the source in a ".lst" file.

Undocumented Z-80 instructions are supported as well as 8080 code.

zmac strives to be a powerful assembler with expressions familiar to C
programmers while providing good backward compatibility with original
assemblers such as Edtasm, MRAS and Macro-80.

This package also includes the ld80 .rel object file linker. ld80 is a
linker for .rel object files as seen on CP/M and TRS-80 machines. It is
a clone of Microsoft's original L80 linker.
