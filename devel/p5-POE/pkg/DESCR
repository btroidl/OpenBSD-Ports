POE is a framework for cooperative, event driven multitasking and
networking in Perl.  Other languages have similar frameworks.  Python
has Twisted.  TCL has "the event loop".

POE provides a unified interface for several other event loops,
including select(), IO::Poll, Glib, Gtk, Tk, Wx, and Gtk2.  Many of
these event loop interfaces were written by others, with the help of
POE::Test::Loops.  They may be found on the CPAN.
