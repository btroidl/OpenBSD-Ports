This project started out as an attempt to automate the release(8)
process on OpenBSD. The prime motivation was to roll my own snapshots in
order to test my and others changes to the kernel, user space and
everything in between. Hence the name robsd as in release OpenBSD. The
scope later grew and the project is by now a kitchen sink for everything
related to building, testing and maintaining OpenBSD. It's written in
ksh with a dash of C and requires nothing other than what's included in
base.

The project is divided into separate utilities. All of them are
configured using a grammar that should be familiar for anyone with prior
OpenBSD experience.
