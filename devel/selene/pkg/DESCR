selene is a command line tool designed to help write correct and
idiomatic Lua code.

Priorities:

- It's okay to not diagnose every problem, as long as the diagnostics
  that are made are never wrong.

- Easy to extend and modify.

- Easy to configure... but the user should need to configure as little
  as possible.
