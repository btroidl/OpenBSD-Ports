SortedSet implements a Set whose elements are sorted in ascending
order (according to the return values of their <=> methods) when
iterating over them.

Every element in SortedSet must be mutually comparable to every
other: comparison with <=> must not return nil for any pair of
elements. Otherwise ArgumentError will be raised.

Currently this library does nothing for JRuby, as it has its own
version of Set and SortedSet.
