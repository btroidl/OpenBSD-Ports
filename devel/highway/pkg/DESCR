Highway is a C++ library that provides portable SIMD/vector intrinsics.

Highway makes SIMD/vector programming practical and workable according
to these guiding principles:

Does what you expect: Highway is a C++ library with carefully-chosen
functions that map well to CPU instructions without extensive compiler
transformations. The resulting code is more predictable and robust to
code changes/compiler updates than autovectorization.

Works on widely-used platforms: Highway supports four architectures;
the same application code can target eight instruction sets, including
those with 'scalable' vectors (size unknown at compile time). Highway
only requires C++11 and supports four families of compilers.
