tea is a productivity helper for Gitea. It can be used to manage most
entities on one or multiple Gitea instances & provides local helpers
like 'tea pr checkout'.

tea tries to make use of context provided by the repository in $PWD
if available.

tea works best in an upstream/fork workflow, when the local main branch
tracks the upstream repo. tea assumes that local git state is published
on the remote before doing operations with tea.
