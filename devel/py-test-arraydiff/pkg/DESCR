This is a py.test plugin to facilitate the generation and comparison
of data arrays produced during tests, in particular in cases where the
arrays are too large to conveniently hard-code them in the tests (e.g.
np.testing.assert_allclose(x, [1, 2, 3])).

The basic idea is that you can write a test that generates a Numpy
array (or other related objects depending on the format, e.g. pandas
DataFrame). You can then either run the tests in a mode to generate
reference files from the arrays, or you can run the tests in comparison
mode, which will compare the results of the tests to the reference ones
within some tolerance.
