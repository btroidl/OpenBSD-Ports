The gitwrapper program is designed to replace git-upload-pack(1) and
git-receive-pack(1) and to invoke an appropriate Git server based on
configuration information placed in gotd.conf(5).  This permits the
administrator to configure which Git server is to be invoked on the
system at run-time.  Git repositories which are listed in gotd.conf(5)
and exist on the filesystem will be served by gotsh(1).  Any other Git
repositories will be served by git-upload-pack(1) and
git-receive-pack(1).
