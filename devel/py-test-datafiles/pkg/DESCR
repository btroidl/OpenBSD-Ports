pytest plugin to create a tmp_path containing a preconfigured set of files
and/or directories.

This plugin allows you to specify one or several files/directories that are
copied to a temporary directory (tmp_path) before the execution of the test.
This means the original files are not modified and every test runs on its own
version of the same files.

Files/directories can be specified either as strings or as pathlib.Path objects.

To take advantage of the datafiles fixture in a test function, add datafiles as
one of the test function parameters (per usual with pytest fixtures) and
decorate the test function with
@pytest.mark.datafiles(file1, file2, dir1, dir2, ...).

The datafiles variable in your test function is a pathlib.Path object (tmp_path)
where the copied files are located.
Under OpenBSD systems this will most likely be some subdirectory of /tmp/.
