Paramiko is a pure-Python implementation of the SSHv2 protocol
providing both client and server functionality.

Direct use of Paramiko itself is only intended for users who need
advanced/low-level primitives or want to run an in-Python sshd.
If you're looking for a high-level SSH library for common client
use-cases, try Fabric (https://fabfile.org) which uses Paramiko.
