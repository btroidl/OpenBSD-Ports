A realistic password strength estimator.

This is a Python implementation of the library created by the team at
Dropbox. The original library, written for JavaScript, can be found
at https://github.com/dropbox/zxcvbn.

- Accepts user data to be added to the dictionaries that are tested
against (name, birthdate, etc)

- Gives a score to the password, from 0 (terrible) to 4 (great)

- Provides feedback on the password and ways to improve it

- Returns time estimates on how long it would take to guess the password
in different situations
