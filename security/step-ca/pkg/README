Initialization
==============

The step-cli package is required and must be used to initialize Step CA.
Execute the following command as user _step-ca to initialize Step CA.

# su -s /bin/sh _step-ca -c "env STEPPATH=${LOCALSTATEDIR}/step-ca step ca init"

Step CA cannot bind to privileged ports. During initialization select a port
above 1024.

Add the CA cert to system store
===============================

The root certificate for step-ca is stored in ${LOCALSTATEDIR}/step-ca/certs/root_ca.crt
which should be added to the system by appending it to ${SYSCONFDIR}/ssl/cert.pem

# cat ${LOCALSTATEDIR}/step-ca/certs/root_ca.crt >> ${SYSCONFDIR}/ssl/cert.pem
