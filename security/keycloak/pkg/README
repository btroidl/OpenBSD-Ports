Config files
============

The default config file for keycloak is stored at:

    ${SYSCONFDIR}/keycloak/keycloak.conf

While the data files are stored at:

    ${LOCALSTATEDIR}/db/keycloak


Working with a reverse proxy
============================

Keycloak needs HTTPS and will not work without a TLS certificate. A reverse proxy
such as nginx, relayd or haproxy, can be used to do TLS termination. In such a
case, keycloak must be told to trust the reverse proxy by setting the
following options in the config file:

    http-enabled=true
    http-port=<desired-http-port>
    proxy=edge


Working in a cluster
====================

Keycloak supports clustered, high availability mode. This needs multicast enabled,
the details of which can be read in multicast(4).

Due to the limitations of Java on OpenBSD, it is recommended to only use the IPv4
stack for keycloak, both in normal and cluster modes.
