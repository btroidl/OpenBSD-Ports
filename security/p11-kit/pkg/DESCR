p11-kit aims to solve problems with coordinating the use of PKCS #11 by
different components or libraries living in the same process, by providing a way
to load and enumerate PKCS #11 modules, as well as a standard configuration
setup for installing PKCS #11 modules in such a way that they're discoverable.
