It is possible to use this port for locally built crates depending on
ring. The following snippet can be added to ~/.cargo/config.toml to
replace ring from crates.io with the patched source from this port:

  [patch.crates-io]
  ring = { path = "${LOCALBASE}/share/ring-${VERSION}" }

One side effect one needs to be aware of is that it changes Cargo.lock
files, so one needs to be careful when dealing with projects that have
it checked into git. This is typically the case for binary crates.
