plass is a password manager inspired by password-store in the essence
but completely reimplemented with a smaller and cleaner interface.  It
doesn't have fancy trees nor colors in the output; the absence of these
is considered a feature.

With plass every password lives inside a gpg(1) encrypted file somewhere
inside ~/.password-store which is managed with the got(1) VCS to keep
track of changes, recover accidental overwrites and synchronize it
across devices.

Two helper utilities are bundled:

 - pwg(1): password and passphrase generator
 - totp(1): TOTP generator
