NOTE: yubikey-manager (ykman) is only partially functional on OpenBSD.

"ykman otp" is not functional as there is no suitable HID backend; some OTP
operations can be done with the old yubikey-personalization CLI tool and the
Qt-based yubikey-personalization-gui package.

For "ykman fido", make sure pcscd is running, and if commands stall,
try removing and reconnecting your YubiKey.
