Authen::WebAuthn lets you validate WebAuthn registration and
authentication responses.

Currently, it does not handle the generation of registration and
authentication requests. The transmission of requests and responses
from the application server to the user's browser, and interaction with
the WebAuthn browser API, is also out of scope and could be handled by
a dedicated JS library.
