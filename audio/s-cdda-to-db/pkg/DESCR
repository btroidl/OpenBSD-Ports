Queries content and data of audio CDs through s-cdda(1), collects
informations (artist, album, song titles, etc.) of desired tracks,
if possible correlates data with a web query against MusicBrainz,
then places encoded tracks as well as a human readable and easily
parseable database in a per-CD directory under a directory tree.
The user is asked to edit the collected information and is given
a hand for the rather sophisticated classical music aware database
layout while doing so.

The audio encoders (and sox(1) without --no-volume-normalize) need
to be installed separately.
